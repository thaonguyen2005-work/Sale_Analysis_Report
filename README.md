## Sale Analysis Report:

This is my personal project utilizing SQL to clean and process a sales database, detecting ouliers and improving data accuracy.

In this project, I employed advanced SQL techniques such as: subqueries, CTES, , and Window Functions to conduct in-depth analysis of key metrics and R-F-M Analysis to identify sale trends.
